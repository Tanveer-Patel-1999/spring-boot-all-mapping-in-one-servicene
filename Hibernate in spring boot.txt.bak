Hibernate in spring boot
========================

Hibernate and ORM
=================

2 : what is Hibernate ?
--> Hibernate is a java framework that simplified the development of java application to interact with the database.
--> Hibernate is a " ORM tool ".
--> Hibernate is an open source and lightweight.
--> Hibernate is a "non-invasive" framework , means it does not forces the programmers to extend / implements any class or interfaces.[ loosely coupled ]
--> It is invented by " Gavin king " in 2001.
--> Any type of application can we build with hibernate framework.[desktop application , web application , spring application, enterprise application ]


1 : what is ORM?
--> ORM : Object relational mapping

--> ORM is a technique used to creating a "bridge" between java application and relational database.
--> ORM is mainly used for Database operations.
--> Every operations should to be in Object formates( CURD ).
--> we have two things
	1 :  java application
	2 :  database
--> Objectc  : In java application we can store the data using " Object ".
--> Relational : In java application we used the relational database.
	A : relational database mean data can be stored in Table formates [ rows and columns ]
--> Mapping : [maped class [object ] to table [Entity class] : we can used mapping the object feild to the table table feild .


3 : Traditional way to save data using "JDBC".[ how JDBC work ]
--> java application [object] : call JDBC API : JDBC API call JDBC drive : To store the data in RDMS .
--> programmers write code manually to store object(data) to database using jdb.

where Hibernate play its role
----------------------------
--> java application [object] : Hibernate framework : store data in database.
--> nows its done automatically by hibernate.
--> mapping your Object to the Table.

4 : 

note:
--> earley we write a sql query with the help of jdbc using Hibernate we does not need to write a sql query hibernate is responsible to wtite a fired a sql query.
--> hibernate create dao [ data access object] automatically.
 
 
Hibernate annotation
====================
1 : @Entity : 					: The @Entity annotation is indicated the class is table in the Db. [@Entity is marking " any class " as a Entity or table is the database.
2 : @Table(name = "table_name)  : It is used to give the name to the table
3 : @Id 						: It is used to create a primary key in the table.[ @Id is marking " any columns " as a primarey key ]
4 : @GeneratedValue 			: It is used to generate a value automatically.
5 : @Columns					: It is used to give the cloumn name.
6 : @Transient					: This tell hibernate not to save this feild.


question for jpa

--> Mapping : [maped class [object ] to table [Entity class] : we can used mapping the object feild to the table table feild .

2 : what is JPA?

--> JPA stands for " java Persistence API".
--> JPA is one of ORM specification.

3 : Explain the Mapping Rule in JPA?

--> we define Entity(POJO) class for one Table.
--> we define one variable for one columns.

4 : what is difference between JPA and Hibernate?
--> 

5 : what are some  advantages of JPA?
--> database independent(Dialect) : we can used any types of data base [ orcale, mysql ]
--> Easy to develop Database operations (CURD operations).
--> JPQL / HQL support.

6 : what is the Spring data OR spring Boot Data JPA repository?
--> There are Three spring data / spring Boot Data JPA repository.
	1 : CurdRepository
	2 : PagingAndSortingRepository
	3 : JpaRepository
	
--> there are interfaces

7 : What is difference between PagingAndSortingRepository and JpaRepository?

--> JpaRepository works only for relational database.
--> like : MySql, Oracle, Postgress etc

--> PagingAndSortingRepository and CurdRepository work on Both SQL and NoSql database.
--> like : mongoDB

8 : what are pre-define methods given by Repository interfaces?

--> save() : insert or update
--> delete()
--> deleteById()
--> findById()
--> findAll()
--> count()
--> existById()

9 : what is Entity class and Explain commonly used annotation for this?

--> Entity class is also called as POJO clas.
--> A class mapped with Database Table is called as Entity class.
--> Entity class must be mapped with Database table using JPA annotation
--> Like @Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column etc

10 : what is the naming convention for finder methods in the spring data repository interface?

--> syntax:
	<ReturnType> findBy<VariableAndKeywords>(DataType params);
--> exm:
	List<User> findByLastName(String lastName);
	
11 : how can we create a custom repository in spring data Jpa?

--> craete a repositoryInterface
--> created repositoryInterface extends
	1 : Repository
	1 : CurdRepository
	2 : PagingAndSortingRepository
	3 : JpaRepository
--> annotated that interface with @repository

12 : what is PagingAndSortingRepository?

--> we can used PagingAndSortingRepository for mainly 2 purpose
	1 : we can used Sorting a data in ascending or descending order.
	2 : we can used for pagination [ we want a data page by page] 
--> PagingAndSortingRepository extend CurdRepository.

13 : what is CurdRepository?

-->

14 : what is @Query used for?
--> @Query annotation is used to write " custom query or user / programmer defined query.
--> By using this query we can write JPQL / HQL query which written by the class and variable name rather than DB Table name and Columns name.
