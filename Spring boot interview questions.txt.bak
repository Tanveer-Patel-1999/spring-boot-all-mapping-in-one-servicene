Spring boot interview questions
================================

1 : what is Sprig?
--> spring is a Framework which is used to making a light-weight , lossley coupled enterprise application in java.
--> It provides predines API for 
	1: Database Operations : CURD Operations
	2: Restfull web services : Integrating one serivces to another services
	3: micro services and security
	
2 : what are the features of spring Framework?
--> Spring provides features are
1 : Predeined template : JDBC Template , hibernate Template
2 : Loose coupling  : it is achive using layers mechanisum : serivces layer, presentation layer , dB layer
3 : light weight
4 : Easy to test
5 : powerfull Abstraction
6 : fast developement (RAD : rapid application developement)

3 : what is dependency injection?
--> dependency injection is a mechanisum to inject a object to a dependebt class.

4 : what are the types of Dependency injection?
--> they are 5 types of dependency injection.
1 : constructor injection
2 : setter injection
3 : Field injection : @Autowired
4 : Circular injection : A is dependent of B object and B is dependent on A object.
5 : Lookup method injection

5 : what is IOC in spring?
--> The full form of IOC is Inversion of Control
--> IOC conatiner is responsible for creating and destroying an object.

6 : what is spring Configuration file?
--> It is XML file which contains the information of classes and how these are linked each other.
--> It is called as " XML configuration file"
--> sample code like
	<bean id = "obj1" class="com.app.EmployeeService">
		<property name="empType">
			<value>export</value>
		</property>
	</bean>
	
	--> bean tag		: indicated object
	--> property tag 	: indicated setter method()
	
7 : what is spring bean?
--> spring bean is also called as object.
--> the spring bean is completely created and destroy by IOC container.
 
8 : difference between Construction and setter injection?
--> if a class have 4 variables and the constructor for those variables at the time of creating an object then u have to pass all 4 variables.

--> for that constructor injection " partial injection " is not possible.
--> but we can achieve " partial injection " by using setter injection.

--> constructor injection allways create new objection if any modification do.
--> setter injection if will not create new instaance if any modification is do.

--> if u have to pass all property in the order then you go for constructor injection.
--> if u have to pass some few property then go for setter injection.

9: what are the Bean Scope spring provided?
--> spring provided five types of scope 

--> Singleton and Prototype work for any type of application.
1 : Singleton : IOC conatiner will create only one object
2 : Prototype : IOC container will create new objecct every time

--> request and session relataed to " web application only"
3 : Request	  : the request is came from " browser " or client application and object is create in IOC container and  onces response is committed then object is actually destroy in the IOC container.
4 : Session	  : Session is nothing but Http session [ login or logout ] login session is created in IOC container and logout session is destroy in IOC container. 
5 : Global-session (not exist in new version of spring)

10 : what is Bean Wiring?
--> linking two object is called as "Wiring".
--> when the beans are Combined together inside the IOC conatiner that is called "Wired" or "Bean wiring".

exam : craete an object of EmployeeRepository and inject in the EmployeeService.

11 : what is Autowiring in Spring and what are the different modes it have?
--> setter injection
--> feild injcetion
--> constructor injcetion

12 : what is difference between @Autowired and @Inject?
--> @Autowired and @Inject are used for same purpose 
--> both are used for dependency injcetion purpose.
--> @Autowired is actually provided by spring framework.
--> @Inject is actually provided by java doubly framework.
--> spring support both @Autowired and @inject.

13 : what is the differnce between @Component and @Bean?
--> both @Component and @Bean are used to created an object.
--> @Component create object inside IOC conatiner.
--> @Component can be used if we have " source code " of a class .[ programmer- define class] at the top of the class we annotated @Component.
--> If class is " pre defined " and want to create objecct inside IOC container then we need to used @Bean (java based configuration) along with @Configuration (java based configuration).

14 : how many types of IOC container are there in Spring?
--> they are two types of container
	1 : BeanFactory : 
		--> BeanFactory is an Interface
		--> BeanFactory is responsible for creating a bean and destroy the bean.
		--> BeanFactory is take "XML" input.[xml configuration]
	
	2 : ApplicationContext :
		--> ApplicationContext is an Interface.
		--> ApplicationContext is internally extends BeanFactory Interface.
		--> It provides some extra functionality on top of BeanFactory.
		--> ApplicationContext is responsible for creating a bean and destroy the bean.		
		1 : Annoation Support
		2 : Reactive Programming etc.
		
15 : what is used of @Required Annoation in Sprig Framework?
--> @Required annotation genrally return on the top of the set() method.
--> the value of the feild must be required it not accept null value.

16 : what is the use of @Autowired annotation in spring?
--> it is used to link (Inject) two beans inside IOC container.
--> @Autowired is most commenly used injection [ link one layer : presentation layer to another layer : serivce layer ]

17 : what is the use of @Qualifier annotation in spring Framework?
--> when we create more than one bean of the same type and want to wire only one of them then we go for @Qualifier annotation.
--> to avoid the embuguity mechanisum of bean with same type then go for the @Qualifier.
--> It is used at the time of Autowired.

18 : what is @Primary Annoation in spring?
--> It is same as @Qualifier 
--> when we create more than one bean of the same type and want to wire only one of them then we go for @Primary annotation.
--> It is used at the time of bean creation.
--> @Primary is used to give highest priority.

19 : what are lifecycle method in spring?
--> they are two lifecycle method in the spring.
	1 : init() metho :
	2 : destroy() method :
--> these method are executed by default by Spring IOC container while creating Object.
--> order of executing
	1 : Creating an Object.
	2 : providing a data using setter injection
	3 : calling init() method.
	4 : destroy() method is called finally object will be destroy.
	
note : destroy() method is something do some task before destroying a object.
--> destroy() : means clean up process.
--> destroy() method not destroy an object.

20 : what are different ways of writing lifecycle method in spring?
--> they are three types :
	--> 1 : Declarative Approach  : using XML
	--> 2 : programmatic Approach : using Spring Integrating.
		implement interface : InitializingBean , DisPosableBean
	-->	3 : Annoation Approach : @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy.
	
21 : what are the common implementions of the ApplicationContext?
---> ApplicationContext is a Spring container.
	1 : FileSystemXmlApplicationContext conatiner class : present the XML file any where inside our project or from your System.
	2 : ClassPathXmlApplictionContext container class :  present the XML file  inside your project in src : resources
	3 : WebXmlApplictionContext container class : it is used when we used web based application.
	
22 : what are the Stereo type annotations?
--> if you used Stereo type annotation top of the class IOC conatiner create an object for that class.
--> they are % Stereo type annotation in Sprig framework
	1 : @Component			: it is used to create an object
	2 : @Controller			: it is used http based web based Application
	3 : @RestController		: it is used to create restfull web services.
	4 : @Service			: it is used to implement a business logic
	5 : @Repository			: it is used to implement a database operation.

23 : what are different module in spring?
-->

24 : what is profile in spring?
-->
